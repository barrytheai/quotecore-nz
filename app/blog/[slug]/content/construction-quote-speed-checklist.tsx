      <p>The first contractor to respond wins 78% of home service jobs.</p>
      <p>Not the cheapest. Not the most experienced. The one who got there first.</p>
      <p>Most contractors lose jobs not because their price is wrong - but because their quote arrived a day too late. Someone else was faster. The client moved on.</p>
      <p>This checklist is designed to fix that. Print it out, stick it in the van, and run through it after every site visit.</p>
      <p>For more on how UK roofers are already building that kind of speed into their quoting process, <a href="/blog/roofing-quoting-software-uk">here is what the shift to digital quoting looks like in practice</a>.</p>

      <h2>Why quotes take longer than they should</h2>
      <p>The site visit is rarely the slow part. It&apos;s everything after.</p>
      <p>Measurements get written on a notepad, transferred to a spreadsheet, rebuilt into a quote, formatted in Word, and sent off - sometimes the next evening, sometimes two days later.</p>
      <p>Every transfer adds time and risk of error. Contractors who quote fast have eliminated most of those steps.</p>
      <p>If a spreadsheet is part of what is creating the delay, <a href="/blog/roofing-quoting-software-vs-spreadsheets">here is an honest look at where roofing quoting software and spreadsheets differ</a> - and where a spreadsheet is actually holding its own.</p>

      <h2>The step that slows most contractors down</h2>
      <p>The step almost every contractor loses time on: entering measurements once - not notepad to spreadsheet to email.</p>
      <p>Most quotes involve entering the same numbers three or four times. Every transfer is time. Every transfer is a chance for error.</p>
      <p>The contractors who quote in 15 minutes have just removed the steps that didn&apos;t need to be there.</p>
