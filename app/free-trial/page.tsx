  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Getting started takes less than ten minutes. Create your account, set up your pricing rates and components once, and you are ready to quote. Upload a site plan, measure the job directly from it, and QuoteCore+ builds the quote automatically using your pricing logic.",

    question: "Who is QuoteCore+ for?",
    answer:
      "QuoteCore+ is built for construction businesses that measure and quote jobs regularly - roofing, plumbing, electrical, cladding, flooring, fencing, landscaping, decking, general building, exterior works, and renovation trades. Led by Shaun's real construction experience and built by the QuoteCore+ team, it is designed for businesses that want a cleaner path from measurements to payment.",

    question: "What are Smart Components\u2122?",
    answer:
      "Smart Components\u2122 are reusable parts of your quoting workflow. You can create components that include materials, labour, waste allowances, measurements, drawings, images, calculations and pricing rules, then reuse them in future quotes. They help each quote make the next quote faster.",
